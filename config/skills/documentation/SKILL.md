# Documentation

## Instructions

When writing documentation, follow these guidelines:

1. **Structure and Organization**
   - Start with a clear title and brief introduction
   - Use consistent heading hierarchy (##, ###, ####)
   - Include a table of contents for long documents
   - Add relevant sections: Overview, Installation, Usage, Examples, API Reference

2. **Clarity and Completeness**
   - Write in clear, concise language
   - Avoid jargon unless defined
   - Include code examples for all major features
   - Document parameters, return values, and error conditions
   - Provide usage examples showing common scenarios

3. **Code Examples**
   - Use realistic, working examples
   - Show both basic and advanced usage
   - Include expected outputs
   - Explain what each example demonstrates
   - Use proper code fencing with language specification

4. **Best Practices**
   - Keep documentation up-to-date with code changes
   - Use active voice and present tense
   - Include diagrams for complex concepts
   - Link related sections
   - Add helpful tips, warnings, and notes in callout blocks

5. **Formatting**
   - Use bullet points for lists
   - Use tables for comparing options
   - Use code blocks for commands and code
   - Use inline code `like this` for code terms in text

Documentation should be accurate, comprehensive, and easy to understand for users at different skill levels.
