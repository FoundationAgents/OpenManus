Abstract
Feature interaction has long been a cornerstone of ranking models
in large-scale recommender systems due to its proven effective-
ness in capturing complex dependencies among features. However,
existing feature interaction strategies face two critical challenges
in industrial applications: (1) The vast number of categorical and
sequential features makes exhaustive interaction computationally
prohibitive, often resulting in optimization difficulties. (2) Real-
world recommender systems typically involve multiple prediction
objectives, yet most current approaches apply feature interaction
modules prior to the multi-task learning layers. This late-fusion
design overlooks task-specific feature dependencies and inherently
limits the capacity of multi-task modeling.
To address these limitations, we propose the Information Flow
Network (INFNet), a task-aware architecture designed for large-
scale recommendation scenarios. INFNet distinguishes features
into three token types, categorical tokens, sequence tokens, and
task tokens, and introduces a novel dual-flow design comprising
heterogeneous and homogeneous alternating information blocks.
For heterogeneous information flow, we employ a cross attention
mechanism with proxy that facilitates efficient cross-modal token
interaction with balanced computational cost. For homogeneous
flow, we design type-specific Proxy Gated Units (PGUs) to enable
fine-grained intra-type feature processing.
Extensive experiments on multiple offline benchmarks confirm
that INFNet achieves state-of-the-art performance. Moreover,INFNet
has been successfully deployed in a commercial online advertising

1 Introduction
Short video platforms such as TikTok and Kwai have surged in
popularity in recent years, offering users a broad spectrum of in-
teractive behaviors, such as clicks, scrolls, comments, and likes,
as illustrated in Fig. 1. In large-scale industrial recommenders,
two trends are converging: an explosion in the scale and hetero-
geneity of high-dimensional features, and the growing adoption of
multi-task learning (MTL) to optimize numerous business objec-
tives [1, 3, 8, 13, 24, 33].
In practice, a single model may process thousands of sequen-
tial features, hundreds of sparse categorical fields, and simultane-
ously serve dozens of downstream tasks. User behavior is typi-
cally represented by a mix of categorical identifiers (e.g., user ID,
item ID) and rich sequence signals (e.g., clicked or liked item his-
tories, augmented with contextual attributes such as creators or
topics) [6, 10, 17, 20, 31, 32]. At the same time, modern MTL recom-
menders aim to jointly optimize diverse objectives ranging from
CTR and watch time to revenue within a single unified framework.
This scale and diversity introduce a central challenge: the feature
interaction stage must be (i) expressive enough to capture complex

dependencies among heterogeneous inputs, (ii) efficient enough to
satisfy strict latency and memory constraints, and (iii) sufficiently
task-aware to mitigate negative transfer across objectives.
From the feature interaction perspective, early architectures such
as FM [16] and DCN [22, 23] handle high-cardinality sparse features
well through linear or cross-layer embeddings, but largely ignore
sequential signals or compress them with coarse pooling. In pro-
duction, sequence data are often truncated and flattened with side
information, producing extremely large token sets directly feeding
these into deep interaction layers incurs prohibitive costs, while
aggressive pooling discards fine-grained temporal and contextual
cues. Attention-based models such as DIN [35] and DIEN [34] allevi-
ate this by applying target-aware attention to select relevant history
for a single target item. However, their unidirectional, single-target
design limits the modeling of broader cross-feature and cross-field
dependencies, especially when multiple attributes jointly influence
relevance.
From the MTL perspective, representative approaches such as
MMoE [14], PLE [19], STEM [18], and HoME [24] introduce expert-
based routing to separate shared and task-specific representations.
Yet these methods typically perform feature interaction before task
routing [29], meaning that the way two features interact is fixed re-
gardless of which task is being optimized. This neglects task-aware
dependencies during the interaction stage, leading to suboptimal
representations and negative transfer. In large-scale deployments
where objectives are optimized jointly under strict efficiency con-
straints, this misalignment can degrade both head and tail perfor-
mance and slow convergence.
To address these challenges, we propose a Task-Aware Infor-
mation Flow Network (INFNet) that introduces task proxy tokens
to inject task-awareness directly into the feature interaction stage.
As shown in Fig. 2, all inputs are represented as categorical to-
kens, sequence tokens, and task tokens. We explicitly decouple
the interaction process into (i) homogeneous flows, which per-
form within-type refinement using lightweight gated units, and
(ii) heterogeneous flows, which enable cross-type exchange via
cross attention with token proxies. In the latter, proxies condense
large token sets into compact anchors, ensuring that cross-type

complexity scales with the number of proxies rather than the raw
token cardinality. Crucially, we introduce both task tokens and task-
shared proxy tokens, allowing early-stage task-aware modulation
of feature interactions while preserving cross-task generalization.
This unified, structured information flow ensures that the target
objective influences heterogeneous feature interactions from the
very beginning of the pipeline.
This design yields a compact yet expressive backbone that (i)
meets industrial efficiency budgets through low-overhead within-
type refinement and proxy-based cross-type exchange, (ii) mitigates
negative transfer via early-stage task conditioning, and (iii) unifies
heterogeneous features into a single, structured interaction flow.
Extensive experiments on both public and large-scale industrial
datasets validate the effectiveness of INFNet; in a production ad-
vertising system, INFNet achieves +1.587% Revenue (REV) and
+1.155% Click-Through Rate (CTR) gains, while maintaining stable
performance across traffic segments and favorable training and
serving characteristics.
Contributions. Our key contributions are as follows:
•We introduce INFNet, a task-aware information flow archi-
tecture that unifies categorical, sequence, and task tokens in
a single interaction space, enabling downstream objectives
to guide feature interactions from the earliest stage rather
than only after feature fusion.
•We design a structured interaction mechanism with two
complementary flows: (i) homogeneous flows using light-
weight gated units for within-type refinement, and (ii) het-
erogeneous flows using cross attention with token proxies to
enable fine-grained cross-type exchange without quadratic
cost growth.
•We propose task-specific and task-shared proxy tokens that
explicitly inject task-awareness into the interaction process,
mitigating negative transfer across objectives while preserv-
ing beneficial cross-task generalization.
•We demonstrate both algorithmic and system-level gains:
consistent improvements on public and large-scale industrial
datasets, with +1.587% Revenue (REV) and +1.155% CTR in a

2 Related Work
We review two closely related lines of research feature interac-
tion and multi-task recommendation highlighting their evolution,
design trade-offs, and limitations in industrial settings.
Feature Interaction. Feature interaction modeling has pro-
gressed from explicit factorization to structured and sequence-
aware designs. Early factorization methods such as FM [ 16] and
its field-aware extensions [9, 15] are efficient and interpretable but
restricted to second-order relations. Deep hybrids like DeepFM [7],
xDeepFM [12], and DCN/DCN-V2 [23] enhance expressiveness via
high-order semantics or polynomial expansions, but still rely on flat,
global interactions that can be inefficient under strict latency and
memory budgets. Recent structured designs such as xDeepInt [25]
and FuXi-𝛼 [26] allow controllable capacity allocation across fields,
improving scalability but focusing mainly on static or aggregated
features and often neglecting fine-grained sequential patterns.
Sequence-aware models, including DIN, DIEN, and DSIN [4], em-
ploy target-aware attention for behavior modeling, while temporal
methods like TiSASRec [11] and TIN [36] encode timing signals
for better interest extraction. Cross-modal designs such as Inter-
Former [28] and HSTU [29] bridge sequence and non-sequence fea-
tures. Despite these advances, sequences are often pooled too early,
weakening conditioning, and task signals are typically injected late,
limiting task-aware crossing in multi-objective scenarios.
Multi-Task Recommendation. Multi-task recommendation
addresses the need to optimize multiple objectives jointly. Expert-
based architectures such as MMoE [14], PLE [19], STEM [18], and
HoME [24] separate shared and task-specific components to im-
prove representation sharing. However, most follow a two-stage
pipeline first performing feature interaction, then applying task-
specific routing overlooking that interaction patterns can be task-
dependent. This late integration of task information risks negative
transfer and suboptimal representations, especially when serving
constraints demand both high efficiency and strong task alignment.
These limitations motivate our approach, which unifies categori-
cal, sequential, and task proxy tokens into a structured information
flow, enabling early-stage task-aware interactions while controlling
computational cost for industrial-scale deployment.
3 Methodology
In this section, we present the task-aware Information Flow Net-
work (INFNet) and its overall architecture in Fig. 3. We first intro-
duce feature pre-processing and tokenization, then describe cross-
/within-type interaction via a stackable INFNet block, and finally
detail the multi-task head and the optimization objective.
3.1 Feature Pre-processing
We unify all inputs into three token types: categorical, sequence,
and task and each contains original tokens (full representation) and
proxy tokens (compact queries). All embeddings share the same di-
mension 𝑑, ensuring compatibility in subsequent interaction layers
and aligning with the information flow design.
Categorical Feature Tokens and Proxy Tokens Categorical
inputs include user/item IDs, static attributes, and bucketized con-
tinuous variables. For the 𝑗-th field with value 𝑣𝑗 ∈{1,...,𝑉 𝑗}and
embedding table Ecat
𝑗 ∈R𝑉𝑗×𝑑:
c𝑗 = Ecat
𝑗 [𝑣𝑗]∈ R𝑑. (1)
Stacking all 𝑀 fields yields:
C = [c1 ∥... ∥c𝑀 ]⊤∈R𝑀×𝑑. (2)
To form categorical proxies, we first flatten all field embeddings
into a single vector, then project it through a shared MLP 𝜙cat and
reshape it into 𝑚proxy tokens:
˜C = Reshape 𝜙cat(Flatten(C)) ∈R𝑚×𝑑. (3)
This preserves global cross-field context before compression, yield-
ing more informative proxies under the same token budget.
Sequence Feature Tokens and Proxy Tokens User behaviors are
grouped into 𝐹 action-specific sequences (e.g., clicks, likes, plays).
We concatenate all behavior-specific sequences to form a unified
sequence token matrix:
S = [s1,1,..., s1,𝑛1 ,..., s𝐹,1,..., s𝐹,𝑛𝐹 ]∈ R𝐿×𝑑, (4)
where 𝐿 = Í𝐹
𝑎=1 𝑛𝑎 is the total number of behavior tokens after
padding/truncation, and each s𝑎,𝑡 is obtained from its embedding
table Eseq
𝑎 . To form proxies, each sequence token passes through a
shared projection 𝜙seq and is pooled within its behavior type (sum
pooling):
˜S =

Í𝑛1
𝑡=1 𝜙seq (s1,𝑡)
...Í𝑛𝐹
𝑡=1 𝜙seq (s𝐹,𝑡)

∈R𝐹×𝑑. (5)
This preserves per-type temporal semantics while keeping a bounded
number of query tokens in heterogeneous flows.
Task Feature Tokens and Proxy Tokens Each real task 𝑖is rep-
resented by an original task tokens, initialized as learnable vectors:
T ∈R𝑁task ×𝑑, (6)
serving as task-specific keys/values and forming the basis for the
corresponding prediction heads.
In addition, inspired by expert networks [18, 19], we introduce
𝑁𝑠 shared task tokens to capture common knowledge across tasks.
These shared tokens can be viewed as a special form of task proxy
tokens, analogous to shared experts in mixture-of-experts architec-
tures, providing a compact query set:
˜T ∈R𝑁𝑠×𝑑. (7)
They participate as queries in heterogeneous attention, enabling
early task-aware conditioning without increasing the overall query
count. Meanwhile, the original T tokens remain in the within-type
refinement stage, ensuring sufficient task-specific expressive capac-
ity.

Figure 3: The overall architecture of our task-aware Information Flow Network ( INFNet). Inputs are tokenized into categorical
C with its proxy set ˜C, sequence S with its proxy set ˜S, and task T with its proxies ˜T. Each block alternates proxy-guided
heterogeneous fusion (cross attention: proxies as Q, raw tokens share K,V) and homogeneous refinement (PGU for C,S,T).
Stacking 𝑁 blocks yields fused proxies ˜C(𝑁+1), ˜S(𝑁+1), and ˜T(𝑁+1); the multi-task head feeds the final-layer task tokens into
task-specific MLPs.
Initialization for the Interaction Stack The first INFNet block
receives:
C(0)= C, ˜C(0)= ˜C,
S(0)= S, ˜S(0)= ˜S,
T(0)= T, ˜T(0)= ˜T.
Proxies act as queries in cross-type cross attention, while orig-
inals serve as keys/values and undergo within-type refinement,
consistent with the subsequent information flow design.
3.2 Information Flow
As shown in Fig. 3, we split the information flow into two stages:
heterogeneous and homogeneous feature interactions, encapsulated
in a stackable INFNet Block. We treat the input tensors as layer
(0); the superscript (𝑙)indexes blocks, and after stacking 𝑁 blocks
we denote outputs with superscript (𝑁+1). Given inputs to the𝑙-th
block categorical tokens C(𝑙), categorical proxies ˜C(𝑙), sequence
tokens S(𝑙), sequence proxies ˜S(𝑙), and task tokensT(𝑙), task proxies
˜T(𝑙), we first apply cross attention for pairwise heterogeneous
interactions among them. Next, Proxy Gated Unit (PGU) handles
homogeneous interactions within each feature type using its proxy,
and residual connections are used for efficiency. The outputs˜C(𝑙+1),
˜S(𝑙+1), and ˜T(𝑙+1)are fed to the next block or the prediction head.
CA(·)and PGU(·)denote cross attention and proxy gated unit,
respectively. Proxies act as attention bottlenecks: they are used as
queries to limit fan-out, while richer (non-proxy) tokens can serve
as keys/values to preserve information.
3.2.1 Heterogeneous Feature Interactions. To enable information
exchange between different feature types, we adopt a cross-attention
mechanism that allows one set of tokens to query another. Intu-
itively, CA can be viewed as an information flow from a key–value
set (K,V)to a query set Q, where the query decides what informa-
tion to retrieve based on content similarity. Specifically, givenQ, K,
and V, cross attention mechanism is defined as:
CA(Q,K,V)= softmax
Q W𝑄(K W𝐾)⊤
√𝑑𝑘

(V W𝑉), (8)
where 𝑑𝑘 denotes the dimensionality of the key and query vectors.
This formulation preserves the flexibility of content-based address-
ing while avoiding the quadratic complexity of self-attention across
all tokens.
Having defined the cross attention operator, we now detail the
specific information flow patterns in our architecture, namely: flow
to categorical, flow to sequence, and flow to task. Each pattern
specifies a distinct query–key–value configuration, determining
how cross-type information is injected.
Information flow to categorical. In the information flow to categori-
cal, categorical proxy tokens serve as the query in cross attention,
while sequence and task tokens act as the key and value in their
respective cross attention. The outputs of these cross attention are
summed to produce the new result ˜C(𝑙)of this information flow.
˜C(𝑙+1)= CA

˜C(𝑙), S(𝑙), S(𝑙)

Information flow to sequence. Similarly, in the information flow to
sequence, sequence proxies serve as the query in cross attention,
while categorical and task tokens act as the key and value in their
respective cross attention. The outputs are summed to produce˜S(𝑙).
˜S(𝑙+1)= CA

Information flow to task. Different from the flows to categorical and
sequence tokens, both task proxies and real-task tokens are few in
number, and each serves a distinct role: task proxies capture shared
cross-task patterns, while real-task tokens focus on task-specific
nuances. To fully exploit their capacity and allow these roles to
complement each other, we perform cross attention for both, using
categorical and sequence tokens as keys/values:
˜T(𝑙+1)= CA

˜T(𝑙), C(𝑙), C(𝑙)

+CA

˜T(𝑙), S(𝑙), S(𝑙)

ˆT(𝑙+1)= CA

T(𝑙), C(𝑙), C(𝑙)

+CA

T(𝑙), S(𝑙), S(𝑙)

.
(11)
Here, ˆT(𝑙+1) serves as an intermediate output enriched with
task-specific information, thereby endowing the task tokens with
explicit and concrete semantics.
3.2.2 Homogeneous Feature Interactions. After heterogeneous in-
tegration, we further refine features of the same type. We adopt
PGU for homogeneous flows to mirror the channel-wise special-
ization role of MLPs in Transformers: Cross-Attention handles
global, cross-type information exchange, while PGU refines intra-
type representations with proxy-conditioned, channel-wise modu-
lation—avoiding redundant token-to-token attention and ensuring
deployment-friendly complexity in large-scale systems.
Let X ∈R𝑛×𝑑 denote the tokens of a given type and ˜X ∈R˜𝑛×𝑑
its ˜𝑛proxy tokens from the heterogeneous stage. We first flatten
˜X along the token dimension to form ˜X𝑓 ∈R˜𝑛𝑑, map it through a
lightweight MLP to produce a channel-wise gating vector g ∈R𝑑,
and then apply a Sigmoid activation to bound the gate values before
broadcasting to all tokens for element-wise modulation:
PGU(X, ˜X)= X ⊙𝜎 MLP(˜X𝑓), ∈R𝑛×𝑑. (12)
In our architecture, categorical, sequence, and task tokens are
all refined using their own proxies:
C(𝑙+1)= PGU C(𝑙), ˜C(𝑙),
S(𝑙+1)= PGU S(𝑙),˜S(𝑙),
T(𝑙+1)= PGU ˆT(𝑙+1), ˜T(𝑙).
(13)
This channel-wise design decouples PGU’s complexity from the
token length 𝑛, making it efficient even for very long sequences
while preserving proxy-conditioned modulation.
3.3 Optimization Objective
Given the enhanced per-task representation T(𝑁)
𝑖 obtained in the
multi-task modeling stage, each task prediction is produced by a
task-specific MLP followed by a Sigmoid activation:
ˆ𝑦𝑖 = 𝜎 MLP𝑖(T(𝑁)
𝑖 ). (14)
This head shares architecture across tasks but maintains separate
parameters, mapping the task proxy representation to a calibrated
probability.
To optimize multiple tasks within a single network, we adopt a
weighted multi-task loss:
L =
𝑁task∑︁
𝑖=1
𝜆𝑖 L𝑖
 ˆ𝑦𝑖,𝑦𝑖
. (15)
where ˆ𝑦𝑖 and 𝑦𝑖 denote the predicted and ground-truth labels for
task 𝑖, respectively. L𝑖 is the task-specific loss function. In this
paper, we choose the binary cross-entropy:
L𝑖
 ˆ𝑦𝑖,𝑦𝑖
 = −
h
𝑦𝑖 log ˆ𝑦𝑖 + (1 −𝑦𝑖)log 1 −ˆ𝑦𝑖
i
. (16)
The weight 𝜆𝑖 (default = 1) balances gradient magnitudes across
tasks and can be tuned via grid search or uncertainty-based methods
when tasks vary in size or difficulty. The network parametersΘ are
optimized end-to-end by minimizing L(Θ)over the training set,
enabling both shared and task-specific learning.
4 Experiment
In this section, we evaluate INFNet by comparing it with feature
interaction models and multi-task recommendation models. We
begin by introducing the experimental setup and analyze the ex-
perimental results.
4.1 Experimental Setup
Dataset. We evaluate INFNet on three public short-video bench-
marks KuaiRand-Pure, KuaiRand-27K [5], and QB-Video [27]—plus
a large-scale internal dataset. As summarized in Table 2, KuaiRand-
Pure is relatively compact, KuaiRand-27K expands to a much larger
item and log scale with the same users, while QB-Video adopts a
different schema and task setup. This mix covers diverse sparsity
levels, feature richness, and task counts, offering a varied testbed
for evaluation.
Baselines. We compare INFNet against two baseline families: fea-
ture interaction models and multi-task recommendation models,
using common instantiations from their original papers and adapt-
ing sequence handling only when required.
Feature interaction models.
•FM [16]: models second-order interactions via factorized
embeddings and linear terms, offering a strong lightweight
baseline for sparse high-cardinality inputs.
•DIN [35]: applies target-aware attention over a user’s his-
tory, improving relevance modeling without heavy sequence
encoders.
•DIEN [34]: builds on DIN by modeling interest extraction
and temporal evolution with attention-updated GRUs and
an auxiliary loss.
•DCN v2 [23]: enhances cross networks with low-rank resid-
ual mixing (CrossNet-Mix) for efficient high-order feature
crossing.
•GDCN [21]: uses gated cross layers and field-level dimension
optimization to filter redundant capacity while improving
expressiveness.
•WuKong [30]: deepens and widens FM blocks under a scal-
ing rule to capture any-order interactions at scale.
•HSTU [29]: treats recommendation as generative sequential
transduction with hierarchical units, excelling on very long
contexts.
Multi-task recommendation models.
•Shared-Bottom [2]: shares a common encoder across tasks
with separate towers; simple but prone to negative transfer.

•MMoE [14]: combines multiple experts via task-specific
gates to reduce interference and adapt to task difficulty.
•OMoE [14]: a lighter single-gate variant of MMoE with less
specialization capability.
•PLE [19]: separates shared and task-specific experts progres-
sively, mitigating the seesaw effect.
•STEM [18]: uses shared and task-specific embeddings with
gating to balance personalization and cross-task sharing.
Evaluation Metric. We report three standard metrics.
•AUC: area under the receiver operating characteristic curve;
measures overall ranking quality. Higher is better.
•gAUC: user-level averaged AUC that weights users more
uniformly to reflect personalization quality. Higher is better.
Unless specified, we compute metrics on the test split and select
checkpoints based on validation performance.
Experiment Settings. For a fair comparison, all methods are eval-
uated under the same data processing pipeline and a consistent
hyperparameter tuning protocol. The batch size is fixed at 4096.
Embedding dimensions are tuned over {8,16,32,64,96,128}. All
models are implemented using the fuxiCTR1 [37] framework, with
necessary extensions for specific architectures. The optimizer is
selected from {Adam, Adagrad}, and the initial learning rate is
searched over {1e−4,3e−4,1e−3}, combined with optional linear
warmup or cosine decay schedules. L2 regularization is tuned from
{0,1e−7,1e−6,1e−5}, and dropout rates are searched in{0.0,0.1,0.2}.
Sequence lengths are tuned per dataset according to validation per-
formance. Early stopping is applied when the validation AUC shows
no improvement for five consecutive evaluations. All reported re-
sults are averaged over three runs with different random seeds to
mitigate randomness and improve robustness.
4.2 Performance Comparison
Table 1 summarizes the overall comparison of INFNet against both
feature interaction and multi-task recommendation baselines on
the public datasets. The main observations are as follows.
•Against feature interaction models. INFNet consistently
achieves higher AUC and gAUC on multiple targets such
as click, like, long-view, and share. This indicates that the
bidirectional heterogeneous information flow in INFNet
integrates categorical fields with multi-behavior sequences
more effectively, leading to stronger high-order interactions
while keeping computational cost manageable.
•Against multi-task models. INFNet shows clear gains
over Shared-Bottom, MMoE, OMoE, PLE, and STEM, espe-
cially on challenging objectives and on KuaiRand-27K where
behavior sparsity and noise are more pronounced. The cross
attention with token proxies, together with hybrid task rep-
resentations that include both shared and real task tokens,

strengthens commonality learning across tasks while captur-
ing task-specific nuances, which reduces negative transfer
and improves overall multi-task performance.
•Robustness across settings. We observe consistent im-
provements across a range of embedding sizes and sequence
truncation lengths, suggesting that INFNet maintains stable
advantages under different capacity and context budgets.
In summary, INFNet delivers consistent improvements over
strong baselines in both the feature interaction and multi-task
regimes, supporting its effectiveness and generalizability for large-
scale short-video recommendation.
4.3 Ablation Study
We evaluate INFNet by removing each major component in turn
while keeping data processing, optimization, and checkpoint se-
lection identical to the main setup. Experiments are conducted on
KuaiRand-pure and QB-video to cover short-video recommendation
and multi-behavior advertising.
Ablated variants: w/o1 — Removes task tokens (learnable task vec-
tors), preventing early integration of multi-task information. w/o2
— Removes homogeneous interaction (PGU updates for categori-
cal, sequence, and task tokens), weakening within-type modeling.
w/o3 — Removes heterogeneous interaction (cross attention across
feature types), limiting cross-type fusion.
As shown in Table 3, the full INFNet consistently outperforms
all variants. (1) w/o1 shows universal drops, especially on share
(+0.0344 AUC), confirming that task vectors improve alignment
with task-specific objectives. (2) w/o2 notably hurts sequence-
dependent tasks (e.g., long-view, follow, like), indicating that per-
type refinement improves feature quality before cross-type mixing.
(3) w/o3 causes the largest losses on most tasks, highlighting the
importance of aligning categorical and sequential evidence under
task context.

follow AUC 0.8842 0.8852 0.8829 0.8881
share AUC 0.7747 0.7868 0.7854 0.8091
Overall, task vectors inject early task awareness, homogeneous
flows strengthen per-type representations, and heterogeneous flows
enable effective cross-type fusion. The full model benefits from all
three for the best performance.
4.4 Effect of Proxy Token Counts
We study how the number of proxy tokens influences INFNet ’s
multi-task performance on KuaiRand-pure, fixing task proxies =
4 and shared task tokens = 2 unless otherwise noted. To isolate
the effect of each factor, we vary one at a time under the same data
pipeline, optimization schedule, and checkpoint selection.
As shown in Fig. 4a–4b, increasing categorical/sequential
proxies from 2 to 4 improves AUC by enabling finer-grained repre-
sentation of their respective feature spaces. More proxies allow the
model to preserve diverse subspaces of categorical and sequential
information, reducing the compression of multiple signals into a
single vector and enhancing alignment between task intent and
relevant regions. However, pushing the number to 8 leads to a drop
in performance, consistent with over-parameterization: excessive
proxies introduce redundancy, dilute attention focus, and increase
optimization difficulty.
A similar pattern emerges for shared task tokens. Increasing
from 1 to 2 yields gains on both click and long-view metrics by better
summarizing cross-task patterns, while still allowing sufficient
capacity for task-specific tokens to specialize. Setting this value
to 3 brings diminishing or negative returns, consistent with over-
sharing: too many shared carriers blur task boundaries and compete
with real task tokens, weakening per-task discrimination. Overall,
categorical/sequential proxies= 4 andshared task tokens
= 2 offer a good trade-off between representation richness and
stability, and serve as robust defaults in our training setup.
4.5 Visualization Analysis
As shown in Fig. 5, we visualize the final layer’s cross attention
where task query all categorical and sequential tokens (x-axis: token
positions; y-axis: query channels). Shared-task channels exhibit
smoother, low-frequency patterns covering broad regions, serving
as carriers of cross-task context, while real-task channels show
sharper peaks aligned with a few salient positions (e.g., ∼60–70,
∼90), emphasizing influential tokens from behavior sequences or
key categorical fields. Dark “corridors” indicate tokens with limited
utility.

Figure 5: Visualization of the final-layer cross attention between task tokens and their proxies. The x-axis indicates feature or
sequence positions, the y-axis corresponds to query channels for individual and shared tasks, and the color intensity reflects
attention weights (brighter indicates stronger attention).
These patterns match our design goals: real tasks specialize in
task-specific cues, and shared tasks provide a broad prior that regu-
larizes and complements them. The attention remains differentiated
yet coordinated broad shared coverage does not overwhelm task-
specific spikes mirroring our quantitative trends that moderate
sharing yields more effective attention than overly concentrated or
diffuse maps.

4.6 Efficiency Analysis
Fig. 6 compares inference time and parameter count of representa-
tive models on KuaiRand-pure, illustrating the trade-off between
complexity and online efficiency. The x-axis shows per-batch in-
ference time (lower is better), and the y-axis indicates model size
(smaller is easier to deploy), with circle size/color reflecting param-
eter magnitude.
Feature interaction models such as DIN, DIEN, and INFNet
achieve low latency and compact sizes, whereas high-order or multi-
expert methods (e.g., MMoE, OMoE, PLE, DCNv2, GDCN) incur
higher cost due to additional branches, routing, or explicit crossing.
Methods like AITM, WuKong, Shared-Bottom, and STEM sit in
between.
Overall, deeper explicit-interaction models and multi-expert de-
signs increase both parameters and inference time, while INFNet
maintains compactness and low latency through hierarchical fea-
ture interaction and task-aware fusion with learnable task vectors,
making it practical under strict latency and resource constraints.
4.7 Online Analysis
This section details the deployment of our model as a real-time rank-
ing system for short-video ads in a large-scale online advertising
system, targeting shallow signals such as click, play, and comple-
tion. Emphasizing task-specific efficiency and revenue impact, we
evaluate the model under a streaming training setup from both
training and serving perspectives. To ensure a fair assessment, the
online experiment uses the same candidate generation and request
routing as the production baseline, and we report results after the
system reaches a steady state.

of INFNet.
4.7.1 Online Deployment. As the model is trained in a streaming
fashion, Fig. 7 illustrates feature generation and label acquisition
during deployment. Upon receiving a ranking-stage request, the
system splits it into two pipelines: inference and training. In in-
ference, context features are sent to the feature server to retrieve
user and video features, which are then scored by the infer server.
In training, the sample producer fetches features, and the label
matcher aligns callback timestamps to generate labels. The updated
model is deployed to the infer server.
Model complexity thus affects both training efficiency and in-
ference performance. To keep the end-to-end cost stable, we reuse
cached embeddings for infrequently changing fields, maintain a
bounded sequence length for behaviors, and apply consistent snap-
shotting so that features and model versions remain time-aligned.
These practices help maintain predictable throughput under fluctu-
ating traffic.
4.7.2 Online A/B Testing. We deployed our model in the main
feed scenario, which serves billions of requests per day. The base-
line, approximately a combination of DIN, DCNv2, and PLE, was
compared against our INFNet model in an A/B test conducted
from 2025-03-10 to 2025-04-10. As shown in Table 4, results show

statistically significant improvements (𝑝-value < 0.05) across all
key metrics, including a +1.587% increase in expected revenue and
+1.155% in click-through rate (CTR). We also observed consistent
gains in short-term user retention indicators, where P3s, P5s, and
PEnd respectively denote the proportion of videos played for at
least 3 seconds, 5 seconds, and until the end: +0.105%, +0.317%, and
+0.351%.
As shown by the latency metrics, our model achieves comparable
efficiency to the baseline, with a slightly lower prediction latency
(18.17 ms vs. 18.28 ms) and reduced training latency (20.04 min vs.
21.21 min). The online ramp-up followed a fixed traffic ratio to avoid
seasonality artifacts, and all comparisons were performed under
the same hardware and quota settings to ensure comparability.
4.8 Conclusion
This paper proposes INFNet, a large-scale multi-task feature in-
teraction framework for recommendation. It treats task as a learn-
able feature and integrates sparse, sequential, and task features
via bidirectional heterogeneous and homogeneous flows. Exten-
sive offline experiments show significant gains across datasets and
objectives. Online results confirm notable improvements in busi-
ness metrics and user experience with efficient inference. Overall,
INFNet demonstrates strong potential and wide applicability in
multi-source feature modeling and multi-task learning for large-
scale recommendation.
