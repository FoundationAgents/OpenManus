        "text": "We present DeepSeek-OCR as an initial investigation into the feasibility of compressing long contexts via optical 2D mapping. DeepSeek-OCR consists of two components: DeepEncoder and DeepSeek3B-MoE-A570M as the decoder. Specifically, DeepEncoder serves as the core engine, designed to maintain low activations under high-resolution input while achieving high compression ratios to ensure an optimal and manageable number of vision tokens. Experiments show that when the number of text tokens is within 10 times that of vision tokens (i.e., a compression ratio  $< 10\\times$ ), the model can achieve decoding (OCR) precision of  $97\\%$ . Even at a compression ratio of  $20\\times$ , the OCR accuracy still remains at about  $60\\%$ . This shows considerable promise for research areas such as historical long-context compression and memory forgetting mechanisms in LLMs. Beyond this, DeepSeek-OCR also demonstrates high practical value. On OmniDocBench, it surpasses GOT-OCR2.0 (256 tokens/page) using only 100 vision tokens, and outperforms MinerU2.0 ( $6000+$  tokens per page on average) while utilizing fewer than 800 vision tokens. In production, DeepSeek-OCR can generate training data for LLMs/VLMs at a scale of  $200k+$  pages per day (a single A100-40G). Codes and model weights are publicly accessible at http://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-OCR.",

The first type is a dual-tower architecture represented by Vary [36], which utilizes parallel SAM [17] encoder to increase visual vocabulary parameters for high-resolution image processing. While offering controllable parameters and activation memory, this approach suffers from significant drawbacks: it requires dual image preprocessing that complicates deployment and makes encoder pipeline parallelism challenging during training. The second type is tile-based method exemplified by InternVL2.0 [8], which processes images by dividing them into small tiles for parallel computation, reducing activation memory under high-resolution settings. Although capable of handling extremely high resolutions, this approach has notable limitations due to its typically low native encoder resolution (below  $512 \\times 512$ ), causing large images to be excessively fragmented and resulting in numerous vision tokens. The third type is adaptive resolution encoding represented by Qwen2-VL [35], which adopts the NaViT [10] paradigm to directly process full images through patch-based segmentation without tile parallelization. While this encoder can handle diverse resolutions flexibly, it faces substantial challenges with large images due to massive activation memory consumption that can cause GPU memory overflow, and sequence packing requires extremely long sequence lengths during training. Long vision tokens will slow down both prefetch and generation phases of inference.",

With the advancement of VLMs, a large number of end-to-end OCR models have emerged, fundamentally transforming the traditional pipeline architecture (which required separate detection and recognition expert models) by simplifying OCR systems. Nougat [6] first employs end-to-end framework for academic paper OCR on arXiv, demonstrating the potential of models in handling dense perception tasks. GOT-OCR2.0 [38] expands the scope of OCR2.0 to include more synthetic image parsing tasks and designs an OCR model with performance-efficiency trade-offs, further highlighting the potential of end-to-end OCR researches. Additionally, general vision models such as Qwen-VL series [35], InternVL series [8], and many their derivatives continuously enhance their document OCR capabilities to explore dense visual perception boundaries. However, a crucial research question that current models have not addressed is: for a document containing 1000 words, how many vision tokens are at least needed for decoding? This question holds significant importance for research in the principle that \"a picture is worth a thousand words.\"",

For CLIP, we remove the first patch embedding layer since its input is no longer images but output tokens from the previous pipeline. Between the two components, we borrow from Vary [36] and use a 2-layer convolutional module to perform  $16 \\times$  downsampling of vision tokens. Each convolutional layer has a kernel size of 3, stride of 2, padding of 1, and channels increase from 256 to 1024.

For minority languages, in the detection part, we find that the layout model enjoys certain generalization capabilities. In the recognition part, we use fitz to create small patch data to train a GOT-OCR2.0, then use the trained model to label small patches after layout processing, employing a model flywheel to create 600K data samples. During the training of DeepSeekOCR, coarse labels and fine labels are distinguished using different prompts. The ground truth for fine annotation image-text pairs can be seen in Figure 5. We also collect 3M Word data, constructing high-quality image-text pairs without layout by directly extracting content. This data mainly brings benefits to formulas and HTML-formatted tables.

Using fewer than 800 tokens (Gundam mode), DeepSeek-OCR outperforms MinerU2.0 [34] which needs nearly 7,000 vision tokens.

For newspapers, Gundam or even Gundam-master mode is required to achieve acceptable edit distances, because the text tokens in newspapers are 4-5,000, far exceeding the  $10 \\times$  compression of other modes.

The preliminary results are encouraging: DeepSeek-OCR achieves near-lossless OCR compression at approximately  $10 \\times$  ratios, while  $20 \\times$  compression still retains  $60\\%$  accuracy. These findings suggest promising directions for future applications, such as implementing optical processing for dialogue histories beyond  $k$  rounds in multi-turn conversations to achieve  $10 \\times$  compression efficiency.",

We believe this finding will facilitate the development of VLMs and LLMs in the future. Additionally, DeepSeek-OCR is a highly practical model capable of large-scale pretraining data production, serving as an indispensable assistant for LLMs. Of course, OCR alone is insufficient to fully validate true context optical compression and we will conduct digital-optical text interleaved pretraining, needle-in-a-haystack testing, and other evaluations in the future. From another perspective, optical contexts compression still offers substantial room for research and improvement, representing a promising new direction.",
