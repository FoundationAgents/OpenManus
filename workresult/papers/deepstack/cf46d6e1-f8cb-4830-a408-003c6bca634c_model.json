We apply DeepStack to both language and vision transformer in LMMs, and validate the effectiveness of DeepStack LMMs with extensive empirical results.

To connect vision and language models for LMMs, a conventional way is transforming images into a number of visual features using pretrained vision encoders (e.g., CLIP [61]), and flattening them to a sequence of \"language tokens\" which are then fed into an LLM. With sufficient alignment and instruction tuning, the entire system can demonstrate a broad conversational capability for multimodal inputs [51]."

This inevitably introduces a tremendous memory and compute overhead into the LLMs, which is particularly significant when it comes to high-resolution images and multi-frame videos. Several previous works attempt to mitigate this issue by proposing various token compression strategies. A straightforward way is to reduce the number of tokens with spatial grouping [70, 47]. Instead of pooling vision tokens, a few work instead to concatenate local tokens along the feature dimension to preserve visual information [11, 48]. Moreover, other works seek more sophisticated token resampling, such as Q-Former [43], Perceiver [4] and Abstractor [8], etc. In MM1 [57], the researchers performed an extensive analysis of these approaches and found no significant discrepancies among them. Despite the huge effort, all these works inherently sacrifice fine-grained visual information to reach the trade-off between the compute overhead and the information flow into LLMs, which is arguably problematic for high-resolution images and videos. Most recently, a few works [22, 48, 50, 19, 20] proposed multi-crop strategies and string several times more visual tokens to support high-resolution scenarios, while at the cost of substantial overhead."

In this work, we step outside the box and question whether we can find a better strategy to handle the large number of visual tokens regarding both efficacy and efficiency. Instead of examining the LLMs in a traditional left-to-right orientation, we adopt a novel bottom-to-top perspective, revealing that they constitute a hierarchical arrangement of transformer layers. Based on this observation, we propose DeepStack, a simple, yet novel way of feeding visual tokens into LLMs. As shown in Fig. 1, instead of putting the long sequence of visual tokens from left to right, we restructure the visual tokens into a layered stack, where each layer of the stack is connected to one layer in the LLMs by simple residual connection. As a result, with the context length unchanged, we can feed into LLMs several times more visual tokens to handle complex visual inputs. Meanwhile, the combination of per-layer parallel attention and layer-by-layer progression can effectively leverage the LLMs' capacity for modeling the dependencies of visual tokens."

Recently, natural language processing (NLP) has witnessed significant progress, particularly with the advent of large language models (LLMs) [74, 87, 64, 6]. Building on the foundational architecture of Transformers [75], language models [18, 74, 87, 64, 6, 39] have demonstrated strong scalability through the pretraining-then-finetuning paradigm. Specifically, BERT [18] utilizes the transformer encoder and introduces a masked language modeling task to pre-train the model on vast unlabelled data, showing excellent performance after fine-tuning on downstream tasks. Other follow-ups [39, 36] continue along the lines of BERT, constantly refining and optimizing its performance. The T5 [64] series further unifies different NLP tasks within an encoder-decoder architecture, demonstrating effectiveness across dozens of language understanding tasks. Meanwhile, the GPT [62, 63, 4] series employs simple decoder-only transformers to pretrain the language model using a unified next-token prediction paradigm. This approach shows remarkable scalability in terms of both model size and data scale. To enhance instruction-following abilities, InstructGPT [59] and ChatGPT emphasize the importance of instruction tuning and Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). These models exhibit excellent capabilities in open-domain conversation tasks, ranging from text generation to question answering. In response to ChatGPT, recent works [74, 15, 38] have made significant efforts in developing an open-source LLMs community. Building on the success of the LLaMA [74] series foundation model, Alpaca [71], Vicuna [15], and GPT-4-LLM [60] showcase the improvements brought by higher-quality instruction datasets. Other works [24, 27, 1, 86] take a different approach, aiming to achieve comparable performance with a much smaller set of parameters. The Phi [24, 27, 1] series revisits the importance of the pre-training corpus and achieves success with models containing around 3 billion parameters. In this paper, we develop our model based on Vicuna [15] and Phi-3 [1], aiming to equip the well-trained LLMs with informative visual tokens and a relatively small training effect."

The success of CLIP [61] and its follow-ups [66, 28, 77] demonstrates the effectiveness of aligning vision and language modalities into a unified semantic space, showcasing promising capabilities in zero-shot classification tasks. More recently, Flamingo [3] and BLIP [44] have utilized visual perceivers [26] to resample visual tokens from image features as inputs for language models through cross-attention. BLIP-2 [42] and Instruct-BLIP [16] further incorporate this mechanism into large language models for tasks such as visual captioning and question-answering. Although visual perceivers can translate image features into a fixed set of visual tokens, they face constraints related to convergence costs and data requirements. In parallel, LLaVA and its follow-ups [13, 76, 47, 50, 49] achieved success in connecting vision and language using a simple projection module. It greatly simplifies the difficulties of alignment tasks and even achieves better performance with less training effort. However, due to the rigorous input resolution of pre-trained models, these directions meet difficulties on downstream tasks requiring finer-grained visual information, e.g. tasks relevant to OCR and documents. To alleviate this problem, recent works [48, 22, 21, 73, 89] utilize a mixture of experts (MOE) schemes to leverage different pretrained vision models, typically assembling the visual tokens along the feature dimension. Other attempts [85, 19, 50] split high-resolution images into multi-crop patches and merge them into a longer sequence, which significantly increases the training and evaluation cost. In this work, we conduct experiments on the projector-based connection framework and revisit the connection scheme that utilizes projected visual tokens for the input layer of LLMs. We find that the early layers of LLMs can also well process visual token inputs. Besides that, we propose a DeepStack scheme to stack finer-grained visual tokens to the early layers of LLMs, enhancing visual capabilities without introducing extra input tokens."

This dual-phase processing fully leverages the LLM's capabilities by combining both encoding and sequence modeling. By integrating high-resolution visual information at multiple layers, DeepStack effectively enhances visual token representation without increasing visual context length, demonstrating its superiority over previous methods."

As presented in Tab. 1, DeepStack outperforms its direct baseline model, LLaVA, on both VQAv2 and GQA, showcasing state-of-the-art performance in traditional VQA tasks. Furthermore, DeepStack consistently surpasses other methods on the recent LMM benchmarks. DeepStack achieves comparable performance on MM-Vet on the experiments based on LLaVA-1.5. However, due to we lack of fancy instruction-following data used in LLaVA-mix-765K, our experiments with LLaVA-Next lag behind the LLaVA-Next.

Traditionally, visual tokens are inserted at the input layer, e.g. 0-th layer. We progressively insert them deeper, initializing the corresponding input embeddings to zero. As shown in Fig. 3 (a), inserting visual tokens before the 8th of 32 decoder layers in Phi-3 results in acceptable performance variations. However, inserting them beyond the midpoint leads to a significant performance drop. This confirms that earlier layers efficiently handle initial visual information integration. We also explore the impact of inserting visual tokens at non-consecutive layers. In Fig. 3 (b), we fixed global visual tokens at the input layer and varied the interval between two decoder layers for stacking high-resolution tokens. All stacking settings consistently improved performance. Finally, we explored the number of layers used for stacking high-resolution tokens. As shown in Fig. 3 (c), increasing the layers for stacking consistently enhances overall performance, with the best results achieved using four layers."

The benefits are particularly significant on tasks that inherently require more tokens, such as high-resolution image understanding. We hope this new DeepStack strategy could open up new ideas on how to connect vision and language for faster and better multimodal models in the regime of LMMs."

Meanwhile, how to systematically decide the starting layer and number of layers also deserves more study. We leave these as promising directions to explore in the future."
