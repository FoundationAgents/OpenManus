            "content": "We present Qwen-Image, an image generation foundation model in the Qwen series that achieves significant advances in complex text rendering and precise image editing. To address the challenges of complex text rendering, we design a comprehensive data pipeline that includes large-scale data collection, filtering, annotation, synthesis, and balancing. Moreover, we adopt a progressive training strategy that starts with nontext-to-text rendering, evolves from simple to complex textual inputs, and gradually scales up to paragraph-level descriptions. This curriculum learning approach substantially enhances the model's native text rendering capabilities. As a result, Qwen-Image not only performs exceptionally well in alphabetic languages such as English, but also achieves remarkable progress on more challenging logographic languages like Chinese. To enhance image editing consistency, we introduce an improved multi-task training paradigm that incorporates not only traditional text-to-image (T2I) and text-image-to-image (TI2I) tasks but also image-to-image (I2I) reconstruction, effectively aligning the latent representations between Qwen2.5-VL and MMDiT. Furthermore, we separately feed the original image into Qwen2.5-VL and the VAE encoder to obtain semantic and reconstructive representations, respectively. This dual-encoding mechanism enables the editing module to strike a balance between preserving semantic consistency and maintaining visual fidelity. We present a comprehensive evaluation of Qwen-Image across multiple public benchmarks, including GenEval, DPG, and OneIG-Bench for general image generation, as well as GEdit, ImgEdit, and GSO for image editing. Qwen-Image achieves state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating its strong capabilities in both image generation and editing. Furthermore, results on LongText-Bench, ChineseWord, and CVTG-2K show that it excels in text rendering—particularly in Chinese text generation—outperforming existing state-of-the-art models by a significant margin. This highlights Qwen-Image's unique position as a leading image generation model that combines broad general capability with exceptional text rendering precision."

Second, for image editing, achieving precise alignment between the edited output and the original image poses dual challenges: (i) visual consistency, where only targeted regions should be modified while preserving all other visual details (e.g., changing hair color without altering facial details) and (ii) semantic coherence, where global semantics must be preserved during structural changes (e.g., modifying a person's pose while maintaining identity and scene coherence)."

Both sets of features are then jointly fed into the MMDiT architecture (Esser et al., 2024) as conditioning signals.

Let \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) denote the image and textual inputs, respectively. Given the user inputs, such as prompts and images, we adopt the Qwen2.5-VL model to extract features. To better guide the model in generating the refined representation latent, while accounting for the varying input modalities across different tasks, we design distinct system prompts tailored for pure text input and text-and-image input, respectively.

Current image foundation models typically train an image VAE with 2D convolutions on massive image datasets to obtain a high-quality image representation. In contrast, our work aims to develop a more general visual representation compatible with both images and videos. However, existing joint image-video VAEs, such as Wan-2.1-VAE (Wan et al., 2025), typically suffer a performance trade-off that results in degraded image reconstruction capabilities. To this end, we leverage a single-encoder, dual-decoder architecture. This design utilizes a shared encoder compatible with both images and videos, alongside separate, specialized decoders for each modality, which enables our image foundation model to serve as a backbone for future video models. Specifically, we adopt the architecture of Wan-2.1-VAE, freeze its encoder, and exclusively fine-tune the image decoder."

The dataset consists of real-world documents (PDFs, PowerPoint slides, posters) alongside synthetic paragraphs, covering both alphabetic (e.g., English) and logographic (e.g., Chinese) languages. During training, we observe that: (1) Balancing reconstruction loss with perceptual loss effectively reduces grid artifacts, which are often observed in repetitive textures like bushes. (2) As reconstruction quality increases, adversarial loss becomes ineffective because the discriminator is unable to provide effective guidance. Based on these observations, we use only reconstruction and perceptual losses, dynamically adjusting their ratio during fine-tuning. Interestingly, we find that finetuning only the decoder can effectively enhance details and improve the rendering of small text, thereby building a solid foundation for Qwen-Image's text rendering abilities. Quantitative and qualitative results are presented in Section 5.2.1."

In the traditional MMDiT block, text tokens are directly concatenated after the flattened image positional embeddings. Furthermore, Seedream 3.0 (Gao et al., 2025) introduces Scaling RoPE, where the image positional encoding is shifted to the central region of the image, and text tokens are considered as 2D tokens with a shape of [1, L]. Then, 2D RoPE (Heo et al., 2024) is used for image-text joint positional encoding. Although this adjustment facilitates resolution scale training, certain rows of positional encodings for text and image, e.g., the 0-th middle row in Figure 8 (B), become isomorphic, making it harder for the model to distinguish between text tokens and the image latent tokens in the 0-th middle row. Yet, it is also non-trivial to determine an appropriate image row to concatenate the text tokens. To address the aforementioned challenges, we introduce Multimodal Scalable RoPE (MSRoPE). In this approach, text inputs are treated as 2D tensors with identical position IDs applied across both dimensions. As depicted in Figure 8 (C), the text is conceptualized as being concatenated along the diagonal of the image. This design allows MSRoPE to leverage resolution scaling advantages on the image side while maintaining functional equivalence to 1D-RoPE on the text side, thereby obviating the need to determine the optimal positional encoding for text. We show the architecture and configuration of Qwen-Image in Table 1."

To balance the training data distribution, the dataset is divided into three splits based on the source of captions: Raw Caption Split, Recaption Split, and Fused Caption Split. Raw Caption Split includes captions provided by websites as well as metadata such as titles or tags originally associated with the images. Although raw captions may introduce noise, they contribute to the model's robustness in handling short text inputs and serve as a vital source of real-world knowledge (e.g., plant names, cartoon IPs) often absent in datasets with synthesized captions. Recaption Split consists of captions generated by the most advanced Qwen-VL Captioner (Bai et al., 2025), which provides more descriptive and structured annotations. Due to model limitations, not all IPs can be accurately identified. Fused Caption Split combines both raw captions and synthesized captions, offering a blend of general knowledge and detailed descriptions. To further improve alignment, we applied both the Chinese CLIP (Yang et al., 2022) Filter and the SigLIP 2 (Tschannen et al., 2025) Filter to remove mismatched image-text pairs from the Raw Caption Split. Additionally, a Token Length Filter was employed to eliminate excessively long captions, and the Invalid Caption Filter discards captions with abnormal content, such as \"Sorry, I cannot provide a caption for this image.\""

Keyword-based retrieval and image retrieval techniques are employed to augment the dataset with targeted patches, to enhance coverage of underrepresented categories. To further improve the model's ability to generate high-quality portraits, we first retrieve photorealistic portraits, cartoon characters, and celebrity images from the People category. Synthesized captions are then generated to emphasize character-specific details, such as facial features, expressions, and clothing, as well as contextual elements such as background, lighting, and mood. This approach aims to enhance both the quality of generated images and the model's instruction-following capability. Additional filters are applied to remove images with face mosaics or blurs, to avoid potential privacy issues and ensure the model's robustness in handling human subjects."

Imposing a strict resolution threshold of \\(1328\\mathrm{p}\\) would lead to significant data loss and distort the underlying data distribution. To improve training efficiency and ensure balanced data distribution, we design a hierarchical taxonomy system for image categorization, inspired by the design principles of WordNet (Miller, 1995). All images in Stage 6 are classified according to this hierarchical taxonomy. Within each category, we retain only images with the highest quality and aesthetic appeal. Furthermore, a specialized resampling strategy is employed to balance data containing text rendering, addressing the long-tail distribution of token frequencies. Such balanced multi-scale training allows the model to retain previously learned general knowledge and ensure stable convergence while adapting to higher-resolution inputs, thereby improving detail generation without sacrificing robustness."

With the help of advanced captioner, this methodology transcends traditional image captioning and generate both detailed image descriptions and structured metadata in a single pass, as shown in Figure 12. The annotation pipeline is designed to be efficient and scalable, allowing us to process large-scale datasets without relying on additional models or post-processing steps.

To ensure high-quality synthesized samples, a rigorous quality control mechanism is employed: if any character within a paragraph cannot be rendered due to limitations (e.g., font unavailability or rendering errors), the entire paragraph is discarded. This strict filtering guarantees that only fully valid and legible samples are included in the training dataset, thereby maintaining high fidelity in character-level text rendering."

This design enables both stages to operate asynchronously and at optimal efficiency, while also supporting on-the-fly updates to the data pipeline without interrupting the ongoing training process. On the Producer side, raw image-caption pairs are first filtered according to our pre-defined criteria, such as image resolution and detection operators. The selected data is then encoded into latent representations using MLLM models (e.g., Qwen2.5 VL) and VAE. Processed images are subsequently grouped by resolution in fast-access cache buckets and stored in a shared, location-aware store, allowing consumers to fetch them immediately without waiting in line. The connection between the Producer and Consumer is achieved by employing a specific HTTP transport layer, which natively supports the RPC semantics required for asynchronous, zero-copy scheduling between the two endpoints. The Consumer is deployed on GPU-dense clusters and is dedicated exclusively to model training. By offloading all data processing to the Producer, the Consumer nodes can devote their entire compute budget to training the MMDiT model. The MMDiT parameters are distributed across these nodes under a 4-way tensor-parallel layout, and every data-parallel group asynchronously pulls pre-processed batches directly from the Producer. Additional consumer-side optimizations are detailed in the following section."

We can broadly regard these as general image editing tasks. Building on the capabilities of Qwen2.5-VL, our model natively supports image inputs: visual patches extracted from the user-provided image are encoded by a Vision Transformer (ViT) and concatenated with text tokens to form the input sequence. We design the system prompt shown in Figure 15 and extract both the input image and textual instructions as inputs to the text stream of Qwen-Image MMDiT."

To enable the model to distinguish between multiple images, we extend MSRoPE by introducing an additional frame dimension, in addition to the height and width used to locate image patches within a single image (see the right part of Figure 14).

All compared VAEs operate at an 8x8 compression rate using a latent channel dimension of 16. Notably, FLUX-VAE (BlackForest, 2024), Cosmos-CI-VAE (Agarwal et al., 2025), and SD-3.5-VAE (Esser et al., 2024) are image tokenizers, while Wan2.1-VAE (Wan et al., 2025), Hunyuan-VAE (Kong et al., 2024), and Qwen-Image-VAE function as joint image and video tokenizers. For a fair comparison, we report effective image parameters (see \"Image Params\" in Table 2). This accounts for converting the 3D convolutions in joint models to equivalent 2D convolutions for image processing. Following prior art, evaluation is conducted on the ImageNet-1k (Deng et al., 2009) validation set at 256x256 resolution for general domain performance. To further evaluate reconstruction capabilities on small texts, we also include reconstruction results on an in-house text-rich corpus covering diverse text sources (PDFs, PPT slides, posters, and synthetic texts) and languages. For improved numerical precision, we evaluate tokenizers using float32. As shown in Table 2, Qwen-Image-VAE achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction performance across all evaluated metrics. Significantly, when processing images, Qwen-Image-VAE activates only 19M parameters in the encoder and 25M in the decoder, achieving an optimal balance between reconstruction quality and computational efficiency."

These benchmarks provide a comprehensive measurement of the model's ability to generate high-quality and semantically consistent images from text prompts. To further evaluate the model's text rendering capability, we separately evaluate its performance on English and Chinese text generation. For English text rendering, we use the CVTG-2K (Du et al., 2025) benchmark, which is specifically designed to assess the readability of the rendered English text. To address the lack of standardized evaluation for Chinese text rendering, we introduce a new benchmark named ChineseWord, which evaluates the model's ability to render Chinese characters, allowing us to systematically assess the model's text rendering performance. Furthermore, to fully evaluate Qwen-Image's ability to accurately render long texts, we conducted an evaluation on LongText-Bench (Geng et al., 2025), a benchmark designed to evaluate the performance on rendering longer texts in both English and Chinese."

These benchmarks test the model's ability to perform open-ended edits based on textual and visual instructions. Second, to evaluate the model's spatial understanding and generative capability in 3D vision tasks, we benchmark its performance on novel view synthesis (Downs et al., 2022) and depth estimation (Bochkovskii et al., 2024). These tasks require the model to infer and generate coherent spatial information conditioned on input images and corresponding textual descriptions. All these tasks can be unified within the TI2I scope, showcasing the general applicability of our approach to diverse multimodal tasks."

With the exception of GPT Image 1 [High], which often fails to maintain overall image consistency, all other models generally perform well in preserving unedited regions. In the top case, where the task is to add both a cat and a dog in a cartoon style, the model must ensure that the new objects match the overall artistic style. We observe that FLUX.1 Kontext [Pro] struggles with consistency when editing non-photorealistic images, while both SeedEdit 3.0 and Qwen-Image produce coherent results that align well with the desired cartoon style. For the middle example, which involves removing all people from a crowded scene—a relatively complex instruction—all models complete the task accurately, differing only in minor details. Additionally, we notice occasional zoom-in and zoom-out effects across different models during editing."

Moreover, our improved multi-task training paradigm and dual-encoding mechanism significantly enhance the consistency and quality of image editing, effectively improving both semantic coherence and visual fidelity. Extensive experiments on public benchmarks consistently demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of Qwen-Image across a wide range of image generation and editing tasks. These results underscore not only the technical robustness of Qwen-Image but also its broad applicability in real-world multimodal scenarios, marking a significant milestone in the evolution of large foundation models."

We envision that by strengthening this capability in foundation models, future interfaces can evolve from purely language-based LUIs (Language User Interfaces) to vision-language VLUIs (Vision-Language User Interfaces). When LLMs struggle to convey visual attributes such as color, spatial relationships, or structural layouts, a VLUI empowered by Qwen-Image can generate richly illustrated, text-integrated imagery—enabling structured visual explanations and effective knowledge externalization, where complex ideas are transformed into comprehensible, multimodal representations."

Crucially, while traditional expert models rely on discriminative understanding—directly mapping inputs to outputs without modeling underlying distributions—Qwen-Image leverages generative understanding: it first constructs a holistic distribution over visual content, from which depth is naturally inferred. This shift from direct inference to distributional reasoning opens new avenues for unified multimodal understanding."

In pose editing tasks, Qwen-Image maintains remarkable coherence in both subject identity and background structure despite significant motion changes—an essential requirement for video generation. Moreover, unlike most image generation approaches that rely on image VAEs, we adopt a video VAE for visual representation. While this introduces greater modeling complexity, it aligns with our core objective: to build a foundation model that generalizes across diverse visual modalities, not just static images."

We argue that achieving true understanding-generation unity rests on three foundational pillars: (1) mastering understanding, (2) mastering generation, and (3) mastering their synergistic integration. As the first work in the Qwen series dedicated to visual generation, Qwen-Image fills a critical gap in the second pillar—generation capability—complementing Qwen2.5-VL, which excels in visual understanding (the first pillar). Together, they form a balanced foundation for the next generation of multimodal AI, paving the way toward Visual-Language Omni systems that are not only capable of perceiving and reasoning but also of generating text-rich, visually coherent imagery—where language and vision are seamlessly fused into illustrative, readable, and semantically faithful visual outputs."

Its contributions extend beyond technical benchmarks, challenging the community to rethink the roles of generative models in perception, interface design, and cognitive modeling. By emphasizing complex text rendering in image generation and addressing classical understanding tasks such as depth estimation through the lens of image editing, Qwen-Image points toward a future in which: (1) generative models do not merely produce images, but genuinely understand them; and (2) understanding models go beyond passive discrimination, achieving comprehension through intrinsic generative processes. As we continue to scale and refine such systems, the boundary between visual understanding and generation will blur further, paving the way for truly interactive, intuitive, and intelligent multimodal agents."
