        "text": "We present Qwen-Image, an image generation foundation model in the Qwen series that achieves significant advances in complex text rendering and precise image editing. To address the challenges of complex text rendering, we design a comprehensive data pipeline that includes large-scale data collection, filtering, annotation, synthesis, and balancing. Moreover, we adopt a progressive training strategy that starts with nontext-to-text rendering, evolves from simple to complex textual inputs, and gradually scales up to paragraph-level descriptions. This curriculum learning approach substantially enhances the model's native text rendering capabilities. As a result, Qwen-Image not only performs exceptionally well in alphabetic languages such as English, but also achieves remarkable progress on more challenging logographic languages like Chinese. To enhance image editing consistency, we introduce an improved multi-task training paradigm that incorporates not only traditional text-to-image (T2I) and text-image-to-image (TI2I) tasks but also image-to-image (I2I) reconstruction, effectively aligning the latent representations between Qwen2.5-VL and MMDiT. Furthermore, we separately feed the original image into Qwen2.5-VL and the VAE encoder to obtain semantic and reconstructive representations, respectively. This dual-encoding mechanism enables the editing module to strike a balance between preserving semantic consistency and maintaining visual fidelity. We present a comprehensive evaluation of Qwen-Image across multiple public benchmarks, including GenEval, DPG, and OneIG-Bench for general image generation, as well as GEdit, ImgEdit, and GSO for image editing. Qwen-Image achieves state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating its strong capabilities in both image generation and editing. Furthermore, results on LongText-Bench, ChineseWord, and CVTG-2K show that it excels in text rendering—particularly in Chinese text generation—outperforming existing state-of-the-art models by a significant margin. This highlights Qwen-Image's unique position as a leading image generation model that combines broad general capability with exceptional text rendering precision.",

Second, for image editing, achieving precise alignment between the edited output and the original image poses dual challenges: (i) visual consistency, where only targeted regions should be modified while preserving all other visual details (e.g., changing hair color without altering facial details) and (ii) semantic coherence, where global semantics must be preserved during structural changes (e.g., modifying a person's pose while maintaining identity and scene coherence).",

However, existing joint image-video VAEs, such as Wan-2.1-VAE (Wan et al., 2025), typically suffer a performance trade-off that results in degraded image reconstruction capabilities. To this end, we leverage a single-encoder, dual-decoder architecture. This design utilizes a shared encoder compatible with both images and videos, alongside separate, specialized decoders for each modality, which enables our image foundation model to serve as a backbone for future video models.

During training, we observe that: (1) Balancing reconstruction loss with perceptual loss effectively reduces grid artifacts, which are often observed in repetitive textures like bushes. (2) As reconstruction quality increases, adversarial loss becomes ineffective because the discriminator is unable to provide effective guidance. Based on these observations, we use only reconstruction and perceptual losses, dynamically adjusting their ratio during fine-tuning. Interestingly, we find that finetuning only the decoder can effectively enhance details and improve the rendering of small text, thereby building a solid foundation for Qwen-Image's text rendering abilities.

In the traditional MMDiT block, text tokens are directly concatenated after the flattened image positional embeddings. Furthermore, Seedream 3.0 (Gao et al., 2025) introduces Scaling RoPE, where the image positional encoding is shifted to the central region of the image, and text tokens are considered as 2D tokens with a shape of [1, L]. Then, 2D RoPE (Heo et al., 2024) is used for image-text joint positional encoding. Although this adjustment facilitates resolution scale training, certain rows of positional encodings for text and image, e.g., the 0-th middle row in Figure 8 (B), become isomorphic, making it harder for the model to distinguish between text tokens and the image latent tokens in the 0-th middle row. Yet, it is also non-trivial to determine an appropriate image row to concatenate the text tokens. To address the aforementioned challenges, we introduce Multimodal Scalable RoPE (MSRoPE). In this approach, text inputs are treated as 2D tensors with identical position IDs applied across both dimensions. As depicted in Figure 8 (C), the text is conceptualized as being concatenated along the diagonal of the image. This design allows MSRoPE to leverage resolution scaling advantages on the image side while maintaining functional equivalence to 1D-RoPE on the text side, thereby obviating the need to determine the optimal positional encoding for text.

Raw Caption Split includes captions provided by websites as well as metadata such as titles or tags originally associated with the images. Although raw captions may introduce noise, they contribute to the model's robustness in handling short text inputs and serve as a vital source of real-world knowledge (e.g., plant names, cartoon IPs) often absent in datasets with synthesized captions. Recaption Split consists of captions generated by the most advanced Qwen-VL Captioner (Bai et al., 2025), which provides more descriptive and structured annotations. Due to model limitations, not all IPs can be accurately identified. Fused Caption Split combines both raw captions and synthesized captions, offering a blend of general knowledge and detailed descriptions. To further improve alignment, we applied both the Chinese CLIP (Yang et al., 2022) Filter and the SigLIP 2 (Tschannen et al., 2025) Filter to remove mismatched image-text pairs from the Raw Caption Split.

To further improve the model's ability to generate high-quality portraits, we first retrieve photorealistic portraits, cartoon characters, and celebrity images from the People category. Synthesized captions are then generated to emphasize character-specific details, such as facial features, expressions, and clothing, as well as contextual elements such as background, lighting, and mood.

To improve training efficiency and ensure balanced data distribution, we design a hierarchical taxonomy system for image categorization, inspired by the design principles of WordNet (Miller, 1995). All images in Stage 6 are classified according to this hierarchical taxonomy. Within each category, we retain only images with the highest quality and aesthetic appeal. Furthermore, a specialized resampling strategy is employed to balance data containing text rendering, addressing the long-tail distribution of token frequencies. Such balanced multi-scale training allows the model to retain previously learned general knowledge and ensure stable convergence while adapting to higher-resolution inputs, thereby improving detail generation without sacrificing robustness.",

Text paragraphs are extracted from large-scale high-quality corpora and rendered onto clean backgrounds using dynamic layout algorithms that adapt font size and spacing based on canvas size. To ensure high-quality synthesized samples, a rigorous quality control mechanism is employed: if any character within a paragraph cannot be rendered due to limitations (e.g., font unavailability or rendering errors), the entire paragraph is discarded.

This design enables both stages to operate asynchronously and at optimal efficiency, while also supporting on-the-fly updates to the data pipeline without interrupting the ongoing training process. On the Producer side, raw image-caption pairs are first filtered according to our pre-defined criteria, such as image resolution and detection operators. The selected data is then encoded into latent representations using MLLM models (e.g., Qwen2.5 VL) and VAE. Processed images are subsequently grouped by resolution in fast-access cache buckets and stored in a shared, location-aware store, allowing consumers to fetch them immediately without waiting in line. The connection between the Producer and Consumer is achieved by employing a specific HTTP transport layer, which natively supports the RPC semantics required for asynchronous, zero-copy scheduling between the two endpoints. The Consumer is deployed on GPU-dense clusters and is dedicated exclusively to model training. By offloading all data processing to the Producer, the Consumer nodes can devote their entire compute budget to training the MMDiT model. The MMDiT parameters are distributed across these nodes under a 4-way tensor-parallel layout, and every data-parallel group asynchronously pulls pre-processed batches directly from the Producer. Additional consumer-side optimizations are detailed in the following section.",

For a fair comparison, we report effective image parameters (see \"Image Params\" in Table 2). This accounts for converting the 3D convolutions in joint models to equivalent 2D convolutions for image processing. Following prior art, evaluation is conducted on the ImageNet-1k (Deng et al., 2009) validation set at 256x256 resolution for general domain performance. To further evaluate reconstruction capabilities on small texts, we also include reconstruction results on an in-house text-rich corpus covering diverse text sources (PDFs, PPT slides, posters, and synthetic texts) and languages. For improved numerical precision, we evaluate tokenizers using float32. As shown in Table 2, Qwen-Image-VAE achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction performance across all evaluated metrics. Significantly, when processing images, Qwen-Image-VAE activates only 19M parameters in the encoder and 25M in the decoder, achieving an optimal balance between reconstruction quality and computational efficiency.",

For English text rendering, we use the CVTG-2K (Du et al., 2025) benchmark, which is specifically designed to assess the readability of the rendered English text. To address the lack of standardized evaluation for Chinese text rendering, we introduce a new benchmark named ChineseWord, which evaluates the model's ability to render Chinese characters, allowing us to systematically assess the model's text rendering performance. Furthermore, to fully evaluate Qwen-Image's ability to accurately render long texts, we conducted an evaluation on LongText-Bench (Geng et al., 2025), a benchmark designed to evaluate the performance on rendering longer texts in both English and Chinese.",

Across all three tiers, Qwen-Image attains the highest rendering accuracy, underscoring its superior ability to render Chinese text.",

These benchmarks test the model's ability to perform open-ended edits based on textual and visual instructions. Second, to evaluate the model's spatial understanding and generative capability in 3D vision tasks, we benchmark its performance on novel view synthesis (Downs et al., 2022) and depth estimation (Bochkovskii et al., 2024). These tasks require the model to infer and generate coherent spatial information conditioned on input images and corresponding textual descriptions. All these tasks can be unified within the TI2I scope, showcasing the general applicability of our approach to diverse multimodal tasks.",

In the top case, where the task is to add both a cat and a dog in a cartoon style, the model must ensure that the new objects match the overall artistic style. We observe that FLUX.1 Kontext [Pro] struggles with consistency when editing non-photorealistic images, while both SeedEdit 3.0 and Qwen-Image produce coherent results that align well with the desired cartoon style.

Moreover, our improved multi-task training paradigm and dual-encoding mechanism significantly enhance the consistency and quality of image editing, effectively improving both semantic coherence and visual fidelity. Extensive experiments on public benchmarks consistently demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of Qwen-Image across a wide range of image generation and editing tasks.

We envision that by strengthening this capability in foundation models, future interfaces can evolve from purely language-based LUIs (Language User Interfaces) to vision-language VLUIs (Vision-Language User Interfaces).

In pose editing tasks, Qwen-Image maintains remarkable coherence in both subject identity and background structure despite significant motion changes—an essential requirement for video generation.

As the first work in the Qwen series dedicated to visual generation, Qwen-Image fills a critical gap in the second pillar—generation capability—complementing Qwen2.5-VL, which excels in visual understanding (the first pillar).

By emphasizing complex text rendering in image generation and addressing classical understanding tasks such as depth estimation through the lens of image editing, Qwen-Image points toward a future in which: (1) generative models do not merely produce images, but genuinely understand them; and (2) understanding models go beyond passive discrimination, achieving comprehension through intrinsic generative processes.
