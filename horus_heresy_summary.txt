### Summary of the Horus Heresy:
The Horus Heresy is a major event in the Warhammer 40,000 universe, characterized by a civil war within the Imperium of Man. It begins when Horus, the Emperor's most favored son and Warmaster, is corrupted by Chaos. After being wounded in battle, he is manipulated into believing that the Emperor is a tyrant who seeks to control humanity.
