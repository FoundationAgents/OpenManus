# Blood Angels - Warhammer 40k

## Overview
The Blood Angels, originally known as the Revenant Legion, were the IX Legion of the original Space Marine Legions under their Primarch Sanguinius. They are particularly well known for their bloodthirsty nature in battle. They are also one of the most long-lived Chapters, and have a refined aesthetic sense.

## History
### Unification Wars & Great Crusade

## Gene-seed
The Blood Angels and all their successors suffer from a psychological need to drink human blood, known as "the Red Thirst". They also may succumb to the Black Rage, a state where they believe they are their Primarch Sanguinius in battle with Horus.

## Culture
Sanguinius transformed the Blood Angels from an army of killers into a Legion of noble warriors that were also well-versed in art and poetry. They strive for perfection in their works and martial discipline.

## Tactics
The Blood Angels are known for their preference for Jumpack-equipped Infantry, close combat, and direct assault. They maintain a larger than average pool of armored vehicles, including unique designs like the Baal Predator.

## Organisation
The Blood Angels are divided into companies, with the First Company composed of Veterans. They have two ruling bodies: the Red Council and the Council of Blood.
