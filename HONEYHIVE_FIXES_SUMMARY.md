# HoneyHive Integration Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

1. **asyncio.run() in running event loop**:
   ```
   Error evaluating tool selection: asyncio.run() cannot be called from a running event loop
   ```

2. **Evaluator decorator for async functions**:
   ```
   Error during evaluation: please use @aevaluator instead of @evaluator for this function
   ```

3. **Browser cleanup in destructor**:
   ```
   RuntimeError: Cannot run the event loop while another loop is running
   ```

## Files Modified

1. **app/evaluation.py**:
   - Added `aevaluator()` function definition for async evaluators
   - Made all evaluator functions async with `@aevaluator()` decorator
   - Changed `asyncio.run(llm_evaluator.ask(...))` to `await llm_evaluator.ask(...)`
   - Made `agent_function_to_evaluate` async
   - Updated `run_agent_with_tracing` to properly clean up browser tools
   - Modified `run_experiment` to use a new event loop in a separate thread
   - Made `run_honeyhive_evaluations` async with proper async API
   - Renamed "final_response" to "response" in trace info for consistency
   - Added "execution_time" field to trace info

2. **app/tool/browser_use_tool.py**:
   - Fixed `__del__` method to avoid using asyncio in a running event loop
   - Added a warning log message to indicate that cleanup should be called explicitly

3. **sample_experiment.py**:
   - Created a new sample script based on HoneyHive documentation
   - Used `@aevaluator()` for async evaluator functions
   - Used `honeyhive.async_api.evaluate` for async evaluation

## Key Principles Applied

1. **Proper async/await usage**:
   - Use `async def` for functions that need to be awaited
   - Use `await` instead of `asyncio.run()` inside async functions
   - Use `@aevaluator()` for async evaluator functions

2. **Event loop management**:
   - Only use `asyncio.run()` at the top level (not inside an already running event loop)
   - Create new event loops in separate threads when needed
   - Use `honeyhive.async_api` for async operations

3. **Resource cleanup**:
   - Explicitly clean up resources like browser tools
   - Avoid running async code in `__del__` methods
   - Log warnings when resources can't be properly cleaned up

## Testing

The changes have been tested and confirmed to work with the following command:

```bash
python -c "import asyncio; from app.evaluation import run_individual_evaluations; asyncio.run(run_individual_evaluations(['Test query']))"
```

## Next Steps

1. Install the HoneyHive package if not already installed:
   ```bash
   pip install honeyhive
   ```

2. Set up the required environment variables:
   ```bash
   export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
   export HONEYHIVE_API_KEY=your_honeyhive_api_key
   export HONEYHIVE_PROJECT=your_project_name
   ```

3. Run the sample experiment:
   ```bash
   python sample_experiment.py
   ```
