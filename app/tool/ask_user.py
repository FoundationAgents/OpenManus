    Use this tool to request input from the user during an interaction.
    This should be used in THREE common scenarios:
    
    1. CONFIRMATION: When asking the user to confirm potentially harmful operations like:
       - Deleting or modifying important files
       - Executing system commands that might affect the user's environment
       - Performing any action that has security implications
       - Making any irreversible changes
    
    2. CLARIFICATION: When you need clarification about the user's intent or more details about the request.
       
    3. FOLLOW-UP: When you're presenting options and waiting for the user to choose one or when you need
       additional input to proceed with the task.
    
    IMPORTANT: You should ALWAYS use this tool when you need a response from the user, rather than just
    adding questions in your thoughts. Without using this tool, the user cannot respond to your questions.
