   - AIM for a **minimum of 300 words per slide* Contain **enough detail** (text, bullets, equations, definitions, or examples)

3. Depth of Content
   - For important concept, include motivation， problem， intuitive explanation， mathematical formulation or equation (if applicable)
   - practical example or application can also be included

4. Completeness & Validity
   - Reflect all provided feedback and correct deficiencies from past versions.
   - MUST No placeholders or incomplete content.
   - Your output will be used directly. Therefore, it must be a ready-to-use result.
